# Vikunja Cross-Platform app

# Development has moved to [go-vikunja/app](https://github.com/go-vikunja/app)

## Vikunja as Flutter cross-platform app.
I have started maintaining the flutter app. It is currently in a very early stage, but already somehow usable. If you have feature requests or issues, please let me know on the issues tab.
Development for IOS has been put on hold as I do not have the resources to develop for IOS.
